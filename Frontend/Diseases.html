        <h2>Citrus Diseases</h2>
        <h4>1. HLB</h4>
        <p>
            Huanglongbing (HLB), often known as citrus greening, is a bacterial infection of citrus
plants. Candidatus Liberibacter is the bacterium that causes this illness. Sucking insects
and plant migration between different countries and continents are two ways that the
bacteria propagate over the diverse range of citrus trees. The Asian Citrus Psyllid
(Diaphorina citri) is an insect that spreads this disease. In citrus trees, the disease hinders
the movement of nutrients. Citrus trees are slowly killed by it. The disease initially appears
as mottling of the leaves, which is followed by short shoots, a slow death of the branches,
and finally small, malformed fruits with bitter juice.

        </p>

        <h4>2. Citrus Canker</h4>
        <p>
            The "Citrus Canker" bacterial disease affects citrus trees and causes harm to crops as well
as trade disruptions. It is brought on by the bacteria Xanthomonas Axonopodis pv. citri. The
signs of citrus canker include yellow halo and raised, brown lesions with water-soaked
edges on fruit, leaves, or stems. Citrus Canker primarily causes spots on the leaves and
imperfections on the fruit's skin. However, when the right circumstances are met for the
illness to spread, more severe problems including leaves dropping off the tree, branches
withering back, and fruits falling off the tree before they are fully formed might ensue.
Splashing rain, insects, and wind are the main ways that these spreads. Insects like aphids
and citrus leaf miners that feed on diseased plants can also carry the bacteria, as can water
droplets from irrigation or rainfall.

        </p>

        <h4>3. Citrus Sooty Mold</h4>
        <p>
            A fungus causes citrus sooty mold, a black, powdery coating that appears on the leaves,
stems, and fruit of citrus plants. Mold grows in the sugary waste products known as
honeydew left behind by aphids, whiteflies, and scale insects. The plant is not harmed by
the mold itself. This opaque layer may block sunlight, which reduces the plant's ability to
use photosynthetic energy and weakens the plant, ultimately resulting in poor development
and fruit. One way to help manage the disease is to reduce the number of insects and
remove any mold.

        </p>

        <h4>4. Citrus Scab</h4>
        <p>
            Citrus scab is a fungal disease that forms rough, corky lesions on citrus plants' leaves,
twigs, and fruit. It primarily affects developing, immature tissues. The fungus that causes
the illness is called Elsinoë fawcettii. The lesions start off as little, raised patches of pale
orange color that progressively darken and form scabs or moles. The scab usually has no
effect on the fruit's inner quality, though it may become less appealing and marketable.
Leaf infection might also cause distortion. It is spread by wind, rain and splashing water.
The contaminated soil along with the plant debris can also be the source of fungal spores
which spreads the disease. The illness is managed with fungicides, and in order to prevent
the fungus from spreading, affected plant material needs to be removed.

        </p>

        <h4>5. Citrus Black Spot</h4>
        <p>
            The fungus that causes Citrus Black Spot, also known as Guignardia citricarpa,
Phyllosticta citricarpa, is responsible for the dark, sunken patches on fruit that reduce its
marketability and aesthetic appeal. The disease primarily affects fruit, but in severe cases,
twigs and leaves may also show symptoms. When the spots, which usually have a yellow
halo surrounding them, become hard, raised lesions, the fruit is no longer appropriate for
sale. In severe cases, citrus black spot can cause early fruit loss, which reduces yield. The
fungus spreads by means of sick plant material and spores carried by the wind or rain which
carries the spores from one plant to another. Management strategies include applying
fungicides, removing fallen fruit and leaves, and enforcing strict quarantine laws in order
to prevent the illness from spreading.
